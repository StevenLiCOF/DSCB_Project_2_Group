Write a function that encrypts a text message using the
[Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). This
encryption technique, used by Caesar and many other people throughout
history, works by replacing each letter by another one that is a fixed
number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, a shift of 2 means A becomes C, since C is 2 letters down
from A in the alphabet. With a shift of 2, "Caesar Cipher" becomes
"Ecguct Ekrjgt". If the shift reaches the end of the alphabet, it
loops over. For example, with a shift of 3, Y becomes B, since we jump
back to a after z.

Write a function `caesar_encrypt(message, num)`, which takes a string
`message` to encrypt, and the `num` parameter as the shifting
number. It should return the encrypted message.

Ideally, punctuation, spaces, and capitalization should stay the same,
but your enemies are on to you and are in pursuit. You found the mole
but you're surrounded. You need to inform your spy network, but you have very little time left. So, any working
implementation of this encryption that gets the message across will do in a pinch, don't worry about preserving
capitalization, etc. If you find some more time before being captured,
you can focus on that part.

-------------------

Here are some examples for you to test your code on:

`caesar_encrypt("Caesar Cipher", 2)` should return `Ecguct Ekrjgt`.

`caesar_encrypt("HELLO", 4)` should return `LIPPS`.

`caesar_encrypt("A shift of zero is nothing.", 0)` should return `A
shift of zero is nothing.`.

`caesar_encrypt("Backwards will also work. Like this!", -2)` should
return `Zyaiuypbq ugjj yjqm umpi. Jgic rfgq!`.

`caesar_encrypt("---====HeY====---", 55)` should return
`---====MjD====---`.

----------------
And finally, if you have a working function, you should be able to use
it to quickly decypher this message written by Caesar himself, using a
17-shift:
