# Syllabus

###capital one data bootcamp,  pilot 2
September 14-25, 2014	

Datascope / Metis
####instructors: Brian Lange, Irmak Sirer


# Goals 

> Primary goal: to enrich and broaden your skills and confidence to ask and answer questions using data, statistcs, and code. 

* Complete two data science projects using python tools and machine learning models and algorithms
 
* Deepen and broaden Python coding ability, quality, and confidence

* Gain understanding of the practice of high-quality data science, emphasizing the importance of good design and communication

* Develop ideas for the application of new skills in your day-to-day work, right away or further in the future

#Schedule & Overview 

###Class time
**AM session**: 9:30am – 12:00pm  
**Lunch/Catching up with the outside world**: 12:00pm – 1:30pm

>
>**Fri 9/25:** project 2 wrap-up, presentations, and celebration! 

# Projects
You will be placed on a team for Project 1 and Project 2. You'll be given data and some proposed questions to answer using it, but ultimately it will be up to your group to work together, choose a focus, and put together a short presentation to give at the end of the project.

# Daily Pair Programming Challenges
We’ll be doing short pair programming challenges every morning as a way to build our skills and meet others in the class. You will be paired up with another person in the class and given a small challenge to solve with code. Your solutions will be submitted via Github, even if incomplete. Pair programming is a technique used by many well respected software companies [big and small](http://www.quora.com/What-companies-have-used-or-are-using-pair-programming-1/answer/Adrian-Carolli) and is great for learning new techniques. You’re welcome to also use it during project work but won’t be required to.

# Assignments
In addition to daily pairing challenges, you will be asked to
submit short assignments via Github to demonstrate understanding of the topics covered. It is not expected for students to work on bootcamp projects outside of class hours, and incomplete assignments will be accepted.

## Tracks & Challenges
Throughout the class you'll be given opportunities to choose challenge assignments related to specific topics you may be interested in. There will be challenges in the following tracks, which were chosen from topics mentioned in your applications:
  - Machine Learning
  - Python
  - Data Visualization

Tracks may be modified if interest in other areas is expressed.

# Our expectations
## The Metis Way
or, "why am I here and not just taking a Coursera course?"

### Project-Based Learning
The best way to learn about data science tools, techniques, and processes is to use them on real, imperfect data for reasons motivated by real goals. So that's what we do, twice over the course of two weeks.

### Focused Time
This is a time to learn and improve without distraction. You will have long chunks of time to spend on projects and assignments, opportunities to apply material right after you learn it, freedom to shape what the end results of your projects look like, but this only works if you put effort into the class.

### Community Support
When it comes to all the aspects of data science, nobody knows everything, including the instructors. Seek help from your neighbors and solidify your own knowledge by teaching others.

### Self-learn With a Safety Net
The lessons and knowledge are important but it's impossible to cover everything in 2 weeks. Taking that as fact, the most valuable thing you can get out of this class is the ability to walk through walls when you encounter them (in other words, learn and problem solve on the fly).

As a result the class is designed to get you "stuck" from time to time. We don't give you all the instructions, because the real world doesn't either. When you do, ask the instructors for help, that's why we're here. But over the course of the two weeks, the aim is that you build skills to not have to ask us as often.


## Given the above, we expect you to: 

* come to class every day  
* contribute to a fun and safe learning environment  
* ask questions 
* learn by listening, learn by doing, learn by sharing, learn by teaching
* show your mistakes (we will too)  
* submit all work on required assignments (complete or incomplete)  
* communicate if you are having trouble with any of the above
