# Block quotes
> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
> Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness.
> For he is truly my brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
> And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
> And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
