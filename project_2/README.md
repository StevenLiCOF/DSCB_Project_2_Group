# Meet your potential clients
## The Bank

Our sales department is starting a campaign. We're trying to get people to subscribe to a term deposit.

We've been recording our success rate on clients for a while. Can you tell us who we can convert based on this data?

Our leads have age, job, employees, their loans, if they have any credit defaults, when we called them, their education, etc. We also recorded if our call was successful or not. What we can learn, what would be useful for us?

## The Hospital

We keep a lot of data on our patients in Cleveland. We also share data with 3 other hospitals.We have all charts, test results, etc. as well as their heart condition on patients. 

Our focus is on heart disease. Can you help us with diagnosis, early warnings with data, or some other way help us understand heart disease better using the data?

We spend a lot storing and cleaning our patient data. Do we need all of that? What is important/what should we care about? And so on...

## The Advertising Firm

We are an ad agency working on personalizing ads, so that you aren't bothered by ads you don’t care about, and only see stuff you may be interested in. 

We usually have demographic information that users provided, but not always. If we are promoting a product that people with income <50k are not interested in, can we identify them and not show the ad?

We collected census data on demographics, age, education, country, occupation, income, etc. Sometimes we know some, sometimes we don’t. Can we fill in missing data using what we have? What else can we learn? 

## The Movie Network

At Office Box Office, we both create movies and purchase rights from other studios to show movies on our expensive cable TV channels and our new streaming service, OBONow.

We hired some interns to scrape user review data from Metacritic. We have user review scores along with some other context (whether other users thought the review was helpful, what date it was posted, etc). Given a user's movie reviews, can we predict whether they've seen a movie or not? Can we use other data about the movie to predict whether users will like it or not?
