# Submitting your first assignment via GitHub! (required)
* Make a fork of [the class repo](https://github.com/thisismetis/capitalone-pilottwo) and clone your fork to your computer 
* Create a file in the `day_01` directory titled `hello_world.md`, type some text in it, and commit and push your updates to your fork.
* Make a pull request from the master branch of your fork to the master branch of [the class repo](https://github.com/thisismetis/capitalone-pilottwo).

## Finished? some optional things to do:

### Finish any installation pieces you need to complete
If you needed to type in your Github login everytime you cloned or pushed, you can [set up SSH keys with Github to avoid this in the future](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/#step-4-add-your-ssh-key-to-your-account)

### Learn more about Markdown and experiment
The ".md" on the end of that file you created stands for Markdown. Markdown is a markup language that makes it easy to write rich text on the web. Its syntax is natural and readable, and it compiles to HTML. GitHub, iPython Notebook, StackExchange, and others allow users to write in Markdown.
We'll be using Markdown in this class to write formatted text for our projects and assignments. Take a look at the [Mastering Markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), try out different Markdown formatting features in your `hello_world.md` file, and push them to your fork on GitHub. Take a look at the pull request you opened earlier and see what happened. You can also try using Markdown in the description and comments on your pull request.

### Dive into code!
Itching to try writing some Python? Sign up for CodeEval, a site with coding challenges for many skill levels. Try solving some of the challenges listed below:

* [Read more](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/167/)
* [Happy numbers](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/39/)

If you make it this far, save your solutions inside the `day_01` folder and push them to your fork, even if you don't come up with a working solution to the problems.
